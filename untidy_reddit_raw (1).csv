4,"Well done, Putin. Top 2022 salesman of NATO. 

Before this stupid, cruel war, Germany didn't want anything to do with NATO, the Bundeswehr was underfunded and the population didn't care for soldiers, Poland started to push against the EU, Orban was openly speaking out against the entire EU project, Spain had troubles of possible sedition (catalans), the entire peace project between NATO/EU states was slowly crumbling. Europe lacked a common goal, something they could all rally behind. Financial prosperity was no longer enough. Member states didn't want to pay for military, they had their naive bubble that Europe would stay at peace, forever.

And now Putin managed to unite the entirety of Europe. NATO is stronger than ever before. Whatever Putin tried to achieve, he failed. Russia is weak. Their military is a joke, compared to the entirety of NATO. Ukraine is a relatively small country, with no Navy, little high tech gear - all they have is an iron will and the passion to defend their homeland from evil. And the 'superpower' , as some believed Russia to be , failed to defeat that. They threw everything they had at Ukraine. Their most advanced weapons. Their best troops. They used other nations to secretly attack Ukraine from the rear, against all international laws that have a meaning. They used mercenaries in secrecy, spies and traitors in Ukraine to give them unfair advantage. And still they failed. The only thing they didn't use are nukes, but those would lead to war with NATO. Ukraine is too close to the EU. Meaning they threw everything they had and could.

 Before, Putin was on one dictator level with China. Now, China has more leverage. They will dictate the years to come in that dual partnership of darkness.

It's only a matter of time until the Russian elite manage to get rid of Putin, one way or the other. He has become a liability. He is no longer giving Russia stability and prosperity. He forgot why and how he rose to power.",2022-06-27,vlvgj4,idxhl5a

There are so many other factors.

For conventional war, artillery seems to be a big deal. Capable logistics is another.

For modern warfare, training to cooperate between forces seems to count for a whole lot more than how many actual humans you have. I'm not talking about training in using your particular piece of equipment. I'm talking about larger scale training where multiple air and ground forces collaborate to achieve something they individually couldn't. Complex operations.

Never mind that technology such as cheap/abundant drones allows an ever increasing capability per human head, and we haven't even entered the age of drone swarms yet.

Feels like an overhang from some bygone era.

376,"Well, It seems like an imposible scenario, unless some NATO country goes in, which won't happen.

IMO Ukraine won't manage to resist past the summer. The attrition is already too high and they have a logistical nightmare with all the different equipment NATO has given.

They cant move nor store fuel reliably and their exports are fucked.

They are also showing they have problems coordinating proper attacks.

So IMO Ukraine won't last much longer, and the only winners of all of this are the US, with all the LNG and military contracts being singned and China and India getting resources much cheaper.",2022-07-02,vplwlk,iejzseu

Their economy hasn't developed in decades, still solely rely on exporting resources, not something they created, not something they developed, just something that happened to be there.. and they've turned to using their primary source of income as their primary bargaining chip when they stand to lose more than anyone else by it... excluded from the world market they have nothing.

715,"As for military equipment, Ukraine claims to have disabled some 1,500 Russian tanks, 3,600 armored vehicles, 750 artillery pieces, and 210 aircraft since February 24, 2022. These are considerable figures according to specialists, although all agree that they are overestimated. About 800 tanks have been lost, or about 7% of the entire Russian army, even though it would be closer to 10% to 15% if we only consider the tanks ready to be sent into battle, according to military specialists.

The state of ammunition reserves also raises questions. Although the former Red Army has huge arsenals inherited from the Soviet era, they are often old equipment. Its reserves of modern weapons are more modest and have been largely depleted. According to the Pentagon, Moscow has already used 60% of its cruise missiles.

‚ÄúWe have noticed that Russia is carrying out far fewer rocket attacks and it has used H-22 rockets; they are old 1970s Soviet rockets,‚Äù noted Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukrainian military intelligence, in The Guardian on June 10, 2022. ‚ÄúRussian cruise missile stocks are probably running out,‚Äù confirmed the British Ministry of Defence in a statement published on 20 June 2022.

We are mostly responsible for the situation, even though NATO and ukrainians have done some immoral bullshit as well.

In the 2014 revolution, most ukrainians had noble intentions indeed, they wanted european wages and stronger democratic representation. The problem is that some western ukrainians used this government overthrow in order to dominate the eastern ukrainians. They were destroying soviet statues and banning the russian language for example, even if all eastern ukrainians spoke russian. You can definitely make the argument that DNR and LNR were created by the FSB, but 100s of thousands of the seperatists wouldnt have been mobilized for the Russian side, if western Ukrainians actually treated them well.

There are also the NATO and economic resources parts of the equation, which deserve entire books dedicated to them as well.

Now lets get to the war. Seems to me that we will eventually win the donbass battle.., but what happens after that, remains to be seen, and it doesnt look to me that the ukrainian side is willing to accept any peace treaty without the Donbass, the crimean lanbridge and the rest...so it is likely we are going to see a total war to the end.",2022-06-29,up1xmu,ie85j8n

It was a continental or European issue, that they failed to resolve diplomatically when they have the chance, leading to a meaningless civilian suffering. Instead of trying everything to end it, Europe and America are actively prolonging this conflict on purposes and worsening it every steps of the way, leaving the entire world be damned just cause they fancy some dick waving contest with Russia.

'But... but... Russia...' Nah fk these Russian blaming bs. The Western governments doesn't give a fck about the rest of the world. If Western governments spent as much efforts to shift foods out of Ukraine as shifting weapons into Ukraine, the global food security would have eased months ago. Look at how quick the West bow down to Erdogan, a dictator demand, just to spite Russia. Or bow at the Bone Saw Prince who has been doing worse atrocities. Or Netanyahu. But can't even make a deal with Russia to ease global fuel prices or global food security

&#x200B;

Not to mention, the hypocrisy of singing about peace and freedom and democracy, while pouring more and more weapons into this conflict. Just to remind that most of the historical bombings across Africa, Asia and Latin America have been done or supported by these same European countries. Literally the current global issue was done by the same guys, whom in the past, to defeat the Nazi German and Imperial Japan, were starving out millions of people in India, China and South East Asian.

And that is why the countries of Europe are now paying very dearly for gas, and Putin earns a lot. Did anyone think that all other suppliers also sell gas at a high price? The United States, for example, or the same Norway - do these countries sell gas at the old low prices? Certainly not. All gas sellers are rowing loot, but Putin is the zloty here. But if someone has a good memory, he can remember that the Europeans themselves, through the courts, canceled the prices for long-term contracts with Gazprom, because at that moment the price on the stock exchange was falling and the Europeans tied prices (through the courts) to the stock exchange. Therefore, now Gazprom sells gas for 5-7 times more expensive than usual.

759,"Posted this on a different thread, but figured I'd drop it here.

Let me throw my hat in here. On every other sub ive been called a putinbot/troll/shill/etc.

I am Russian born to a Ukrainian (born in Crimea) Mother and Russian Father. I have been in the US for 30 years now, consider myself an American. I speak Russian fluently, understand Ukrainian very well, and spent most of my early childhood in Crimea (Kerch, Feodosiya, etc). I have family on both sides of this war. I have family in Kiev, Moscow, and still in Crimea. It is my family, my people being killed on both sides of this war.

It absolutely pisses me off how both countries I consider mine are being pitted against each other. I'm not going to get into the whole CIA backing of the 2014 revolution, clear war crimes in Donbas and Luhansk, and the clear actions of NATO, the EU and the US government to push the world to the edge of WW3. People have been warning about this war for decades, even the current head of the CIA said years ago that if we keep antagonizing Russia, this is what will happen.

Yes, Putin is a piece of shit, but to say there weren't legitimate reasons for the invasion is ridiculous, and I'm not talking about the denazification propaganda. There is enough blame to go around. Placing the blame 100% at Russia's feet is naive at best. Ukraine is not the beacon of democracy that the west says it is. The reason Ukraine is so important to Europe and the US, other than sticking a thumb in Russia's eye, is it is the money laundering capital of the world. Gangs, Mafia, government, all take a slice of the pie.

Why do you think Rand Paul wanted the 40BILLION dollars of aid to be audited? Because he knows most of that shit will end up in peoples pockets. Lets also not forget that what is happening in Ukraine now, America has done multiple times. America destabilized the entire middle east with our imperialistic bullshit. We destroyed Iraq, Libya, Syria. We funded terrorists and basically created ISIS. What kills me most about this whole situation is the hypocrisy of these people, blaming Russia for doing shit many other countries have done in recent history.

The only quick way out of this is a peace deal. That simple. Its not ideal, but it will stop the killing and give Russia and Ukraine a ground to work from. Problem is, when Zelensky tried to put Minsk 2 into action, Azov absolutely refused orders. There are videos of this. Zelensky was extremely close to making peace deals with Russia multiple times the last few months, yet every time there was a visit from a European leader or a US politician to get him back in line. Peace is not in the best interest of the US and Europe. They are looking at this as a way to weaken Russia permanently. Again, enough blame to go around. Unfortunately the MSM will never be honest about this war. Even after all of the lies about Iraq, lies about Trump, Lies about everything, people still believe the shit they peddle.

772,"So I'm with another question to Russian people. Here I see that many of the Russia supporters call foreign fighters being mercenaries, so justifying for their handling of such. 

So a **question from me**: How do you define what is a mercenary and what isn't?

As I have been doing some digging, trying to justify foreign fighters being mercenaries and have come to this [definitive guide of what is and isn't a mercenary](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/470-750057).

1. A mercenary shall not have the right to be a combatant or a prisoner of war.

2. A mercenary is any person who:

* ‚ùì (a) is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict;

* ‚úÖ (b) does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities;

* ‚ùì (c) is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party;

* ‚úÖ (d) is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict;

* ‚ùì (e) is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict; and

* ‚úÖ (f) has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.

Two contentious points being (a), (c) and (e).


(a) If *recruited* is the same as *volunteered* then this is criteria stands.

(c) This is the point I see touted here the most. I did not find anything concrete about the pay in any kind of official or advertised manner. So at the very least the pay is not used to attract the fighters, yet I also haven't found anything saying that substantial pay is offered even after arrival. I asked my acquaintance how much if any is he getting paid for being there, and he said fuck-all, and after further inquiring said around $300/mo when converted. So at least in his case the ""substantially in excess of promised pay to other armed forces combatants"" criteria wouldn't hold.

(e) Some say that to be a member of the armed forces all you need to do is to join the structure of the armed forces in an official manner and be subordinate to their command, which foreigners do. But they haven't been trained by the armed forces and bring their own training. I haven't found anything regarding is this is considered a point of distinction or not. 

So I hate to be that guy who screams ***source*** with foam coming out of his mouth, but I would like to prove foreign fighters are indeed mercenaries as stated by the definition but I lack evidence. So anyone knows some sources I couldn't find?",2022-06-15,up1xmu,icgyeqh

Further, it has sufficient armour for a direct hit to be necessary with something of a decent caliber to properly disable them - difficult to achieve with an aerial attack if some anti-air is there to assist. And of course, a high fire rate and high precision to create significant damage before it retreats.

We're seeing a violent culmination of Ukrainian denial of history and whitewashing Nazi criminals and toleration of large violent Nazi groups and Russian romanticisation of Imperialism and association with psychotics like Dugin and policy of threats of ""rebuilding"" pre-1917 Russian Empire.

781,"I don't understand why Western onlooker can't look at this war without their rose tinted glasses. This is not the 19th century anymore, there are undeniable facts out there.

Like, everyone could agree that the Russia's initial plan to quickly capture Kiev failed miserably. Their attempts on Kiev and on the north led to lots of human power and resources without much to show for (other than destruction to the local population of course). Then the sinking of their flagship was a huge disaster. The loss of all of their generals too.

But for Ukraine, why it is so hard to admit that they fked it up big time here:

1. Knowing the power of Russian force now, then the fall of Kherson, Melitopol were a disaster. They could have blown up the Crimea bridge and limit all Russian operation in the south. Or blowing up the bridge leading to Kherson and could protect everything West of the Dniper.
2. Related to 1st point, losing Berdiansk and Volnovakha, leading to the encircling of Mariupol and the loss of more than 5000 experienced troops ( 3500 prisoners) were a disaster. How can anyone think the surrendering of a whole army is a success? Like if the Russians veteran fighters were surrounded and surrendered in the thousands, we would have all laughed at how much of a bunch of losers they are.
3. Defending Mariupol was a success in buying time, was it? For what? Mariupol is literally the Russian most important target in the entire Ukraine (just behind Kiev and Odessa). Russia will never be able to take Kiev or Odessa, even if they thrown all the men in Mariupol there. Even Kharkiv is not as important strategically as Mariupol. The event unfolded after Mariupol showed that the bought time Mariupol provided didn't help Ukraine much as we now knows this war will continue to be grinded for years
4. Trying to defend every single untenable position, while admirable, was frankly stupid. Why ppl think guarding an entrenched position while Russian just pounded your positions using artillery is considered as 'bleeding the Russians'? Russian current strategy is literally sending out a scouting party, probing for where Ukraine is firing from, then pound that position days and night will artillery shells till the Ukraine can't tend their positions anymore and either get overrun or retreat. The Russians are literally trading time and resources to reduce their own casualties, something the American war is all about. So what is with these 'professional, tactical retrograde' and 'holding on positions to bleed the Russian' bs. The Ukraine should have withdrawn from Sievierodonetsk, cut off the bridge, and defend/ retake Popasna to secure their flank. Now they are losing their nature defend of the Siversky river (which is what holding the Russians back all this time), lost their flank and all of the men guarding there (Zolete, Popasna, etc) and Lysychansk and all defenders gonna get surrounded.
5. Playing down losing Sievierodonetsk and soon Lysychansk as some unnamed towns, are also dumb as fk. As mentioned, they had the Siversky river ran through them, which is a proven natural barrier to defend against the Russian. And both of them are also in top 50 largest cities in Ukraine. That is like calling Tampas, Oakland, or Minami as 'some nameless towns'

There was a saying, about how the fascist will always lose in war. Cause they can't handle reality, underestimate the opponent while big up their own achievement. The Russians were guilty of that during their 1st phase of the war, and get their arses kicked badly. But now it's the Ukraine and the West turn. If they keep smoking their own propaganda, and think 'the Russian is bleeding out and won't be able to continue soon', then they gonna lose this big time if their prediction is incorrect",2022-06-26,up1xmu,idtvt1g

788,"The Biggest issue I have with this war, besides the War crimes that get committed(Primarily by one side) is the reasoning that given by Pro Russians on this war.   


1. Russia wanted Ukraine to be a border ground between them and NATO.   
This is a complete Fantasy  for 2 main reasons, In 2014 Russia invaded Ukraine after a popular uprising from the people towards a president who didn't want to enter the European Union, something that was wanted by a majority of Ukrainians, With that invasion this pushed Ukraine to be distrustful and hateful of Russia, Pushing them towards NATO. So no there's no NATO aggression, not like in the Cold War. In Short, You can't get mad that the person you punched ends up not liking you and wanting to be in a group with your enemy's    
2.  Russia feeling threatened.  
This one is the only one that actually has merit mostly because NATO is a Threat to Current Russia. Not because NATO is Going to Invade Russia but because NATO wants to Curb Russian Expansion so they are in the way of Russia having a larger sphere of influence. Mind you NATO is not planning to invade Russia any time soon, at least in a first strike sense. NATO has always been a more defensive alliance rather then Offensive one. Just look at the response to the IRAQ war and Afghanistan sepretly, one was more condoned because one was for aggression and the other mostly a defensive reaction. Did Ukraine Drop bombs into Russia before the war began?? Did Georgia Commit terrorist attacks against Russia before its invasion??  ITs a flat out no to both questions. And just like America's invasion of Iraq, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is unjustified and has no moral standing and should have never happened.   
3. War Crimes done by Ukraine.  
I am not gonna sit here and say that Ukraine is innocent in the war of Donbass before this current conflict. But I am not going to blow it out of proportions. There is no Genocide of Russians being committed, there never was, especially when half of the country itself is either Russian or a mix of Russian and Ukrainian. Just to give you an idea of what the Ukrainians where doing prior to war, I'd say in some ways very similar to Ireland in its attempt to reclaim its original language. They were never outlawing Russian all they were doing was encouraging the return of Ukrainian alongside Russian, so that the history and Language of Ukraine wouldn't be lost to time. So no there is little to no evidence for a Genocide, or even the implementations of one. so this reason is a mute point.  
4. Denazification.  
This ones been thrown a lot, especially with the Azov battalion, The Azov battalion are neo Nazis. That is a fact. But Russia itself has an actual disturbing amount of Neo Nazis as well,  and in Russia it is way more prevalent then Ukraine. The same goes for the US. The US and Russia have more of a Nazi Problem then Ukraine had at the start of the war. The far right Party in Ukraine which is supported by Azov got only 2 percent in the last election. while both Russia and the US have at least 5-10 percent of their population depicting nationalistic Nazi tendency's. Many genuine Far right/ Nazi Political leaders where actually kicked out of office by both Porchenko(honestly I forgot how to spell his name) and Zelensky. Many were Fired or Voted out of office in the last 5 years. Ironically Zelenskys Party in Ukraine is a center left liberal party who won over 70% of the vote. So no this wasn't even for Denazification.   
5. Its the US's fault all a long(no it wasn't.)  
I propose a scenario for you one that will portray the situation but in the NA region. If Mexico were too try and join the CSTO. The US would feel threatened by that, having a Russian Ally on their doorstep would scare many Americans and the US itself. However the US would never do a pre emtive invasion of Mexico. For 2 Simple Reasons. One, the US has to much economic infrastructure to risk a war with Mexico, and Two. Because unlike Russia the US is not a one Party Far Right Reactionary Dictatorship. So there would never be a consensus on the issue, if the Democrat's were in power during this situation the Dems wouldn't do anything. If the Republican's where in Power they also wouldn't do anything, not because they don't want to but because they can't, It would be political suicide, would cause a recession and would likely mean the other party taking over, The US would loose massive amounts of credibility within its own country and around the world. Many Allies of the US would probably leave them in that situation and it would put the US in a worse position. and even then after all this the US still invades. The US has no Justification for it, because the Mexican people choose to join the CSTO. The same Way the Ukrainian, Finish, and Swedish now wish to be in NATO, and should be allowed to because its their wish and after a subsequent invasion of a neighbor of Russia's (in the case of Finland and Sweden) and for Ukraine, well getting Invaded is a good fucking reason to join a defensive alliance.

&#x200B;

SO My conclusion is. If you are Pro Russia that is fine, I disagree with you on every level on this conflict but that's your choice. However Do not go spoutting lies and propaganda about why Putin Started this war. WE already know why. Putin Wants to  Improve Russia's World standing. He wants to have Control over Ukraine and Belarus, Weather as a genuine ally, Puppet, or Directly. He himself said. 'Ukraine is not a sovereign Country' Its ok to support either side, but do not lie to your self that Putin was only trying to protect from scary NATO. He Invaded a sovereign country because they were trying to befriend a Foreign Enemy.   


(Epilogue) So when  you say why doesn't Ukraine beg for Peace, or Why doesn't the US and the West stop supplying Ukraine with weapons. Remember to tell yourself that it wouldn't bring a white peace for both sides to enjoy, its your Pro Russia Side getting a victory. so do not blame the west for supplying Ukraine, the same way the US couldn't blame Russia for supplying the Taliban in Afghanistan. You can get mad that they are but do not whine that its warmongering, because if the situation was reverse You would be saying the same thing to me about Russia Supplying (insert US Enemy Here) because its Geo politics. Don't cry when the Person you Punched Punches' back. and Don't except them to Grovel when they are holding their own against you even if its with some support.",2022-05-14,up1xmu,i8mi0te
789,"OK, Lisichansk did fall much much faster than I expected

Fighting did happen though, so not like the Russian was just rolling it. But the defense was collapsing super fast. Did the defenders surrender? Or there were just a few units staying back as token units? We won't know till further information, I guess

Note: Ukraine always announce falling of their own city beforehand, so they can drive the narrative. Not this time though, so maybe they were a bit surprised by how quick it is

Either way, the Russian would be delighted that they were crossing the river and taking an Ukrainian stronghold without much casualties. No major river gonna be on their way till the Dniper now too

Edit: ok, the Ukrainian MOD was announcing that the city was not fully surrounded and still in Ukraine hand earlier today. So unless he was lying then, otherwise the defenders of Lisichansk must have surrendered",2022-07-02,up1xmu,iem821t

You most likely won't get any breathing room till you leave all of Ukrainian territory which also means donbass and luhansk territory.

Thousands of people trapped, not allowed to enter Poland nor to go back into Belarus. And on top of that, Lukachenko actively blocked humanitarian aid. All these people were used as pawns to hurt the EU, because they put sanctions on Belarus because of his treatment of political opponents.

Excerpt: 

> When I returned for dissertation research in 2012, the default language was still Russian. Whenever I told people that my Ukrainian was stronger than my Russian, though, most people switched to Ukrainian. This was especially so with young people, who had mostly been educated in Ukrainian after 1991 (before 1989, Ukrainian-language schools were quite rare in the city). They chatted and cursed in Russian, but when I asked if they spoke Ukrainian, their beautiful...... slightly formal Ukrainian would come out. ""Of course! We learned it in school! We are Ukrainian citizens, and no one speaks Ukrainian better than Kharkivites!"" And of course no one in Ukraine spoke more idiomatic, sarcastic, and hilarious Russian, either.

[...]

> A new war would prove quite different from past Russian offensives during the summer of 2014 and winter 2015. Those battles resulted in the Minsk I and II ceasefires, imposed on Ukraine at gunpoint, but the deals are widely acknowledged in Moscow to have been failures that did not achieve Russia‚Äôs political aims. Repeating such operations‚Äîlimited wars to coerce Ukraine into a deal‚Äîwould come at great economic cost in exchange for no tangible benefit. Ukraine‚Äôs armed forces have improved and expanded considerably since 2014. A smaller war confined to the Donbas would incur higher casualties today, without good prospects for achieving any political objectives. If Russia seeks a quick and decisive victory, it will therefore have to dramatically expand the scope of the conflict‚Äîand the types of forces employed.


> Russia has positioned more than 150,000 troops to surround Ukraine from Belarus in the north to Crimea in the south. Together with Russian-led forces in the Donbas, and auxiliaries including Rosgvardia, Russia‚Äôs national guard, this figure may exceed 190,000. These ground forces are supported by hundreds of tactical aircraft, forward-deployed attack helicopters and the Russian navy. This is not a force for a limited campaign, but one designed to pursue maximalist political aims. Russia will seek to surround and isolate Ukrainian forces in pockets of territory, forcing them to surrender, and attempt to impose regime change in Kyiv.


> The Russian disposition of forces suggests that its general staff intends to conduct two major pincer movements into Ukraine. The lesser of the two will advance from the north on the capital, Kyiv. The larger attack will seek to encircle Ukrainian forces near Donbas. Russian-led units there may serve as a pinning force, while the main Russian grouping would advance from the north-east by Kharkiv and from Crimea in the south. In this scenario, Moscow would try to prevent Ukrainian forces from being able to conduct an organised retreat to more defensible terrain west of the Dnieper river.


> This war would begin with air strikes, missile strikes and use of electronic warfare and cyber-attacks. Their goal would be to degrade, fragment and paralyse the Ukrainian armed forces along with its political leadership. This air campaign would be brief, followed by a combined arms ground offensive. Russia‚Äôs ground force is an artillery army with tanks and mechanised infantry. It emphasises decisive use of firepower. These formations would be backed by attack helicopters, tactical bombers and missile brigades. Those supporting elements would dramatically increase the effectiveness of Russian ground formations in combat.


> Although Ukraine‚Äôs armed forces have improved since the fighting of 2014-2015, so have Russia‚Äôs. The units surrounding Ukraine are largely staffed by contract soldiers‚Äîprofessional servicemen, rather than conscripts‚Äîwith high levels of readiness, modernised equipment and officers bloodied in several conflicts, such as the war in Syria. Ukraine‚Äôs military is understaffed, poorly supplied, and inexperienced in manoeuvre warfare. Russian forces therefore have considerable quantitative and qualitative superiority.


> Much is contingent in war, but Ukraine‚Äôs odds are grim in a conventional fight, even with Western-supplied weapons. Its forces might convert into partisan warfare, or take to the cities. The latter would prove a difficult decision as urban warfare is immensely destructive. Moscow probably hopes to organise local security forces, or to co-opt political elites, to avoid being dragged into urban combat. The current Russian force may be enough to occupy Ukraine‚Äôs eastern regions and the capital, but if Russian leaders believe they can control large parts of the country, they are likely to be walking into a sustained insurgency.

> The big question is whether Russia can translate the use of military force into achieving its political goals and what will it do if it can't? A Russian invasion now would be an attempt to achieve what 2014-2015 failed to do, so more force is likely and compromise is less likely.

In reality, if Russia and NATO were actually at war, Russia would‚Äôve been defeated quite quickly.

Not only that, but it's shown those fence-sitters, like Finland and Sweden, where safety really lies.

All good for NATO.

Not only that, it's a chance for the West to see who is really on our side, and who is supporting the Dark Side - people like India and Hungary. And where China sits.

Not only that, Putin has shown his hand and gone all in on tyranny. Now no one can pretend they don't see what he really is - except of course those people that are the same kind, and now we can see who they are too.

The sanctions will slowly have an effect on Russia's economy, and eventually break them financially. A weak military AND a weak economy will push Russia back to the 1990s.

This is similar to the UK's defence approach to the Falkland Islands. 

The problem with this defence is:

1) It relies on good intelligence and a belief that it is necessary to ""pull the trigger"" and commence the operation. We saw with Ukraine that European intelligence was shoddy and actions were delayed so as ""not to antagonise"" Russia even as it completed its own build-up.

2) Without sufficient missile defence Russian strikes could take out the airfields and any pre-positioned equipment sitting in warehouses before NATO soldiers arrive to disperse it. At which point you're back to racing to the Suwalki Gap.

""The Russian Federation has announced the closure from next week to October 2021 of part of the Black Sea in the direction of the Kerch Strait for warships and state vessels of other countries under the pretext of military exercises.

 Such actions of the Russian Federation are another attempt in violation of the norms and principles of international law to usurp the sovereign rights of Ukraine as a coastal state, as it is Ukraine that has the rights to regulate navigation in these areas of the Black Sea.

 This step is also a gross violation of the right to freedom of navigation guaranteed by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.  According to the Convention, the Russian Federation must not obstruct or impede transit through the international strait to ports in the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.

 Against the background of the ongoing increase in its military presence along the border with Ukraine on land, Russia has begun to intensify the escalation at sea.  It transfers warships from the Caspian Sea and strengthens its military potential in the Azov-Black Sea region, and, despite the lack of legal grounds, decided to close this area to warships of other countries, including Ukraine.

 The behavior of the Russian side indicates the absence of any intention on its part to refuse to continue the aggression against Ukraine using military and hybrid methods.

 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine strongly protests against these actions of the Russian Federation and demands the immediate cancellation of the decision to illegally close certain waters of the Black Sea.

 We call on international partners to increase political and diplomatic pressure on the aggressor state in order to cancel the decision to close the waters and stop the escalation in the Azov-Black Sea region.""",2021-04-15,mrh8sa,gum74us

There's no way Russia doesn't know how these things are getting in to the country - between satellite intelligence, human intelligence, signal intelligence, etc.  Yet they're not bombing or attacking any of those lanes.  Assuming it is correct that they know how these things are coming in to the country, I think they're not attacking because they respect the NATO alliance and know that their military is not up to the challenge.  They would be wiped out in a head-to-head with NATO, which would leave nuclear weapons as the only alternative.  Nukes are a no-win proposition in warfare.

2777,"I think the one thing that everyone forgets is that the countries that have nuclear weapons only have them so that they DON'T have to use them.  They're a deterrence, and considered the sum of all end games for whomever ends up using them. 

RuSSia wants to occupy Ukraine and/or the geographically important parts to the south and east. It would have been quicker & easier to level an entire city like Mariupol with one atomic WMD than the 2 months of constant shelling and bombing... but nuking something into submission is counterproductive to any plans of setting up shop in the coming decades.   


The wildcard in this current situation is the respect, sympathy, and compassion of innocent people and all human life that Putin obviously lacks. I really think it would take a direct attack on Moscow or other large culturally or militarily important places on RuSSian soil in order for Putin to go all-in on proving how big of a douchebag he is.
