2,Poland also announced that they plan to double their armed forces from 120k to 300k and increase military spending to 3% of the GDP. They’ve been calling for the rest of NATO to increase their military spending as well.,2022-06-27,vlvgj4,idxit01
3,"Remember, NATO knows more than we’re being told. That’s an alarming amount of troops at the ready.",2022-06-27,vlvgj4,idxh1fc
4,"Well done, Putin. Top 2022 salesman of NATO. 

Before this stupid, cruel war, Germany didn't want anything to do with NATO, the Bundeswehr was underfunded and the population didn't care for soldiers, Poland started to push against the EU, Orban was openly speaking out against the entire EU project, Spain had troubles of possible sedition (catalans), the entire peace project between NATO/EU states was slowly crumbling. Europe lacked a common goal, something they could all rally behind. Financial prosperity was no longer enough. Member states didn't want to pay for military, they had their naive bubble that Europe would stay at peace, forever.

And now Putin managed to unite the entirety of Europe. NATO is stronger than ever before. Whatever Putin tried to achieve, he failed. Russia is weak. Their military is a joke, compared to the entirety of NATO. Ukraine is a relatively small country, with no Navy, little high tech gear - all they have is an iron will and the passion to defend their homeland from evil. And the 'superpower' , as some believed Russia to be , failed to defeat that. They threw everything they had at Ukraine. Their most advanced weapons. Their best troops. They used other nations to secretly attack Ukraine from the rear, against all international laws that have a meaning. They used mercenaries in secrecy, spies and traitors in Ukraine to give them unfair advantage. And still they failed. The only thing they didn't use are nukes, but those would lead to war with NATO. Ukraine is too close to the EU. Meaning they threw everything they had and could.

 Before, Putin was on one dictator level with China. Now, China has more leverage. They will dictate the years to come in that dual partnership of darkness.

It's only a matter of time until the Russian elite manage to get rid of Putin, one way or the other. He has become a liability. He is no longer giving Russia stability and prosperity. He forgot why and how he rose to power.",2022-06-27,vlvgj4,idxhl5a

There are so many other factors.

For conventional war, artillery seems to be a big deal. Capable logistics is another.

For modern warfare, training to cooperate between forces seems to count for a whole lot more than how many actual humans you have. I'm not talking about training in using your particular piece of equipment. I'm talking about larger scale training where multiple air and ground forces collaborate to achieve something they individually couldn't. Complex operations.

Never mind that technology such as cheap/abundant drones allows an ever increasing capability per human head, and we haven't even entered the age of drone swarms yet.

Feels like an overhang from some bygone era.

His cover is blown, the façade has collapsed and Russia has been exposed as a weak and insignificant country on the international playing field, their military is nothing what it was claimed to be.. and sure, it's still a significant force purely by numbers and they can brute force a lot of fights with complete disregard for life on either side, but proven to be entirely incompetent.

Their economy hasn't developed in decades, still solely rely on exporting resources, not something they created, not something they developed, just something that happened to be there.. and they've turned to using their primary source of income as their primary bargaining chip when they stand to lose more than anyone else by it... excluded from the world market they have nothing.

715,"As for military equipment, Ukraine claims to have disabled some 1,500 Russian tanks, 3,600 armored vehicles, 750 artillery pieces, and 210 aircraft since February 24, 2022.

About 800 tanks have been lost, or about 7% of the entire Russian army, even though it would be closer to 10% to 15% if we only consider the tanks ready to be sent into battle, according to military specialists.

The state of ammunition reserves also raises questions. Although the former Red Army has huge arsenals inherited from the Soviet era, they are often old equipment. Its reserves of modern weapons are more modest and have been largely depleted. According to the Pentagon, Moscow has already used 60% of its cruise missiles.

“We have noticed that Russia is carrying out far fewer rocket attacks and it has used H-22 rockets; they are old 1970s Soviet rockets,” noted Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukrainian military intelligence, in The Guardian on June 10, 2022. “Russian cruise missile stocks are probably running out,” confirmed the British Ministry of Defence in a statement published on 20 June 2022.

We are mostly responsible for the situation, even though NATO and ukrainians have done some immoral bullshit as well.

In the 2014 revolution, most ukrainians had noble intentions indeed, they wanted european wages and stronger democratic representation. The problem is that some western ukrainians used this government overthrow in order to dominate the eastern ukrainians. They were destroying soviet statues and banning the russian language for example, even if all eastern ukrainians spoke russian. You can definitely make the argument that DNR and LNR were created by the FSB, but 100s of thousands of the seperatists wouldnt have been mobilized for the Russian side, if western Ukrainians actually treated them well.

There are also the NATO and economic resources parts of the equation, which deserve entire books dedicated to them as well.

Now lets get to the war. Seems to me that we will eventually win the donbass battle.., but what happens after that, remains to be seen, and it doesnt look to me that the ukrainian side is willing to accept any peace treaty without the Donbass, the crimean lanbridge and the rest...so it is likely we are going to see a total war to the end.",2022-06-29,up1xmu,ie85j8n

From China, India, South East Asia, to Latin America to Africa, we have seen how American and European governments are sacrificing the entire world economy and global food security  just to spite on Russia

As Dr. Subramaniam Jaishankar put it: ""Europe has to grow out of the mindset that Europe's problems are the world's problem but the world's problems are not Europe's problems"".

The fact is: 'Russian invasion of Ukraine' to countries like China, Brazil, India...etc... isn't that much different to US's invasion on Iraq, or Saudi invasion on Yemen. It was a continental or European issue, that they failed to resolve diplomatically when they have the chance, leading to a meaningless civilian suffering. Instead of trying everything to end it, Europe and America are actively prolonging this conflict on purposes and worsening it every steps of the way, leaving the entire world be damned just cause they fancy some dick waving contest with Russia.

'But... but... Russia...' Nah fk these Russian blaming bs. The Western governments doesn't give a fck about the rest of the world. If Western governments spent as much efforts to shift foods out of Ukraine as shifting weapons into Ukraine, the global food security would have eased months ago. Look at how quick the West bow down to Erdogan, a dictator demand, just to spite Russia. Or bow at the Bone Saw Prince who has been doing worse atrocities. Or Netanyahu. But can't even make a deal with Russia to ease global fuel prices or global food security

&#x200B;

Not to mention, the hypocrisy of singing about peace and freedom and democracy, while pouring more and more weapons into this conflict. Just to remind that most of the historical bombings across Africa, Asia and Latin America have been done or supported by these same European countries.

The United States, for example, or the same Norway - do these countries sell gas at the old low prices? Certainly not. All gas sellers are rowing loot, but Putin is the zloty here. But if someone has a good memory, he can remember that the Europeans themselves, through the courts, canceled the prices for long-term contracts with Gazprom, because at that moment the price on the stock exchange was falling and the Europeans tied prices (through the courts) to the stock exchange. Therefore, now Gazprom sells gas for 5-7 times more expensive than usual.

On one hand, there is clear video and footage of Ukrainian soldiers withdrew and tried to form a defense line along the Siversk and Bakhmut highway.

759,"Posted this on a different thread, but figured I'd drop it here.

Let me throw my hat in here. On every other sub ive been called a putinbot/troll/shill/etc.

I am Russian born to a Ukrainian (born in Crimea) Mother and Russian Father. I have been in the US for 30 years now, consider myself an American. I speak Russian fluently, understand Ukrainian very well, and spent most of my early childhood in Crimea (Kerch, Feodosiya, etc). I have family on both sides of this war. I have family in Kiev, Moscow, and still in Crimea. It is my family, my people being killed on both sides of this war.

It absolutely pisses me off how both countries I consider mine are being pitted against each other. I'm not going to get into the whole CIA backing of the 2014 revolution, clear war crimes in Donbas and Luhansk, and the clear actions of NATO, the EU and the US government to push the world to the edge of WW3. People have been warning about this war for decades, even the current head of the CIA said years ago that if we keep antagonizing Russia, this is what will happen.

Yes, Putin is a piece of shit, but to say there weren't legitimate reasons for the invasion is ridiculous, and I'm not talking about the denazification propaganda. There is enough blame to go around. Placing the blame 100% at Russia's feet is naive at best. Ukraine is not the beacon of democracy that the west says it is. The reason Ukraine is so important to Europe and the US, other than sticking a thumb in Russia's eye, is it is the money laundering capital of the world. Gangs, Mafia, government, all take a slice of the pie.

Why do you think Rand Paul wanted the 40BILLION dollars of aid to be audited? Because he knows most of that shit will end up in peoples pockets. Lets also not forget that what is happening in Ukraine now, America has done multiple times. America destabilized the entire middle east with our imperialistic bullshit. We destroyed Iraq, Libya, Syria. We funded terrorists and basically created ISIS. What kills me most about this whole situation is the hypocrisy of these people, blaming Russia for doing shit many other countries have done in recent history.

The only quick way out of this is a peace deal. That simple. Its not ideal, but it will stop the killing and give Russia and Ukraine a ground to work from. Problem is, when Zelensky tried to put Minsk 2 into action, Azov absolutely refused orders. There are videos of this. Zelensky was extremely close to making peace deals with Russia multiple times the last few months, yet every time there was a visit from a European leader or a US politician to get him back in line. Peace is not in the best interest of the US and Europe. They are looking at this as a way to weaken Russia permanently. Again, enough blame to go around. Unfortunately the MSM will never be honest about this war. Even after all of the lies about Iraq, lies about Trump, Lies about everything, people still believe the shit they peddle.

772,"So I'm with another question to Russian people. Here I see that many of the Russia supporters call foreign fighters being mercenaries, so justifying for their handling of such. 

So a **question from me**: How do you define what is a mercenary and what isn't?

As I have been doing some digging, trying to justify foreign fighters being mercenaries and have come to this [definitive guide of what is and isn't a mercenary](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/470-750057).

1. A mercenary shall not have the right to be a combatant or a prisoner of war.

2. A mercenary is any person who:

* ❓ (a) is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict;

* ✅ (b) does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities;

* ❓ (c) is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party;

* ✅ (d) is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict;

* ❓ (e) is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict; and

* ✅ (f) has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.

Two contentious points being (a), (c) and (e).


(a) If *recruited* is the same as *volunteered* then this is criteria stands.

(c) This is the point I see touted here the most. I did not find anything concrete about the pay in any kind of official or advertised manner. So at the very least the pay is not used to attract the fighters, yet I also haven't found anything saying that substantial pay is offered even after arrival. I asked my acquaintance how much if any is he getting paid for being there, and he said fuck-all, and after further inquiring said around $300/mo when converted. So at least in his case the ""substantially in excess of promised pay to other armed forces combatants"" criteria wouldn't hold.

(e) Some say that to be a member of the armed forces all you need to do is to join the structure of the armed forces in an official manner and be subordinate to their command, which foreigners do. But they haven't been trained by the armed forces and bring their own training. I haven't found anything regarding is this is considered a point of distinction or not. 

So I hate to be that guy who screams ***source*** with foam coming out of his mouth, but I would like to prove foreign fighters are indeed mercenaries as stated by the definition but I lack evidence. So anyone knows some sources I couldn't find?",2022-06-15,up1xmu,icgyeqh

Further, it has sufficient armour for a direct hit to be necessary with something of a decent caliber to properly disable them - difficult to achieve with an aerial attack if some anti-air is there to assist. And of course, a high fire rate and high precision to create significant damage before it retreats.

We're seeing a violent culmination of Ukrainian denial of history and whitewashing Nazi criminals and toleration of large violent Nazi groups and Russian romanticisation of Imperialism and association with psychotics like Dugin and policy of threats of ""rebuilding"" pre-1917 Russian Empire.

From Ukrainian side, we see consequences in Russia getting into confirmation bias spiral about Nazi Ukraine.

From Russian side, we see consequences countries formerly occupied by Russian Empire being chief supporters of Ukraine and counting on Russian army getting bled dry and unable to try to capture the territories occupied by Russian Empire (that is Poland and Baltic countries).

781,"I don't understand why Western onlooker can't look at this war without their rose tinted glasses. This is not the 19th century anymore, there are undeniable facts out there.

Like, everyone could agree that the Russia's initial plan to quickly capture Kiev failed miserably. Their attempts on Kiev and on the north led to lots of human power and resources without much to show for (other than destruction to the local population of course). Then the sinking of their flagship was a huge disaster. The loss of all of their generals too.

But for Ukraine, why it is so hard to admit that they fked it up big time here:

1. Knowing the power of Russian force now, then the fall of Kherson, Melitopol were a disaster. They could have blown up the Crimea bridge and limit all Russian operation in the south. Or blowing up the bridge leading to Kherson and could protect everything West of the Dniper.
2. Related to 1st point, losing Berdiansk and Volnovakha, leading to the encircling of Mariupol and the loss of more than 5000 experienced troops ( 3500 prisoners) were a disaster. How can anyone think the surrendering of a whole army is a success? Like if the Russians veteran fighters were surrounded and surrendered in the thousands, we would have all laughed at how much of a bunch of losers they are.
3. Defending Mariupol was a success in buying time, was it? For what? Mariupol is literally the Russian most important target in the entire Ukraine (just behind Kiev and Odessa). Russia will never be able to take Kiev or Odessa, even if they thrown all the men in Mariupol there. Even Kharkiv is not as important strategically as Mariupol. The event unfolded after Mariupol showed that the bought time Mariupol provided didn't help Ukraine much as we now knows this war will continue to be grinded for years
4. Trying to defend every single untenable position, while admirable, was frankly stupid. Why ppl think guarding an entrenched position while Russian just pounded your positions using artillery is considered as 'bleeding the Russians'? Russian current strategy is literally sending out a scouting party, probing for where Ukraine is firing from, then pound that position days and night will artillery shells till the Ukraine can't tend their positions anymore and either get overrun or retreat. The Russians are literally trading time and resources to reduce their own casualties, something the American war is all about. So what is with these 'professional, tactical retrograde' and 'holding on positions to bleed the Russian' bs. The Ukraine should have withdrawn from Sievierodonetsk, cut off the bridge, and defend/ retake Popasna to secure their flank. Now they are losing their nature defend of the Siversky river (which is what holding the Russians back all this time), lost their flank and all of the men guarding there (Zolete, Popasna, etc) and Lysychansk and all defenders gonna get surrounded.
5. Playing down losing Sievierodonetsk and soon Lysychansk as some unnamed towns, are also dumb as fk. As mentioned, they had the Siversky river ran through them, which is a proven natural barrier to defend against the Russian. And both of them are also in top 50 largest cities in Ukraine. That is like calling Tampas, Oakland, or Minami as 'some nameless towns'

There was a saying, about how the fascist will always lose in war. Cause they can't handle reality, underestimate the opponent while big up their own achievement. The Russians were guilty of that during their 1st phase of the war, and get their arses kicked badly. But now it's the Ukraine and the West turn. If they keep smoking their own propaganda, and think 'the Russian is bleeding out and won't be able to continue soon', then they gonna lose this big time if their prediction is incorrect",2022-06-26,up1xmu,idtvt1g

&#x200B;

I assume that ""Ukraine started aggression first"" argument is probably neither 100% true nor 100% false, but somewhere in between. So how much truth is there to that statement?

788,"The Biggest issue I have with this war, besides the War crimes that get committed(Primarily by one side) is the reasoning that given by Pro Russians on this war.   


1. Russia wanted Ukraine to be a border ground between them and NATO.   
This is a complete Fantasy  for 2 main reasons, In 2014 Russia invaded Ukraine after a popular uprising from the people towards a president who didn't want to enter the European Union, something that was wanted by a majority of Ukrainians, With that invasion this pushed Ukraine to be distrustful and hateful of Russia, Pushing them towards NATO. So no there's no NATO aggression, not like in the Cold War. In Short, You can't get mad that the person you punched ends up not liking you and wanting to be in a group with your enemy's    
2.  Russia feeling threatened.  
This one is the only one that actually has merit mostly because NATO is a Threat to Current Russia. Not because NATO is Going to Invade Russia but because NATO wants to Curb Russian Expansion so they are in the way of Russia having a larger sphere of influence. Mind you NATO is not planning to invade Russia any time soon, at least in a first strike sense. NATO has always been a more defensive alliance rather then Offensive one. Just look at the response to the IRAQ war and Afghanistan sepretly, one was more condoned because one was for aggression and the other mostly a defensive reaction. Did Ukraine Drop bombs into Russia before the war began?? Did Georgia Commit terrorist attacks against Russia before its invasion??  ITs a flat out no to both questions. And just like America's invasion of Iraq, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is unjustified and has no moral standing and should have never happened.   
3. War Crimes done by Ukraine.  
I am not gonna sit here and say that Ukraine is innocent in the war of Donbass before this current conflict. But I am not going to blow it out of proportions. There is no Genocide of Russians being committed, there never was, especially when half of the country itself is either Russian or a mix of Russian and Ukrainian. Just to give you an idea of what the Ukrainians where doing prior to war, I'd say in some ways very similar to Ireland in its attempt to reclaim its original language. They were never outlawing Russian all they were doing was encouraging the return of Ukrainian alongside Russian, so that the history and Language of Ukraine wouldn't be lost to time. So no there is little to no evidence for a Genocide, or even the implementations of one. so this reason is a mute point.  
4. Denazification.  
This ones been thrown a lot, especially with the Azov battalion, The Azov battalion are neo Nazis. That is a fact. But Russia itself has an actual disturbing amount of Neo Nazis as well,  and in Russia it is way more prevalent then Ukraine. The same goes for the US. The US and Russia have more of a Nazi Problem then Ukraine had at the start of the war. The far right Party in Ukraine which is supported by Azov got only 2 percent in the last election. while both Russia and the US have at least 5-10 percent of their population depicting nationalistic Nazi tendency's. Many genuine Far right/ Nazi Political leaders where actually kicked out of office by both Porchenko(honestly I forgot how to spell his name) and Zelensky. Many were Fired or Voted out of office in the last 5 years. Ironically Zelenskys Party in Ukraine is a center left liberal party who won over 70% of the vote. So no this wasn't even for Denazification.   
5. Its the US's fault all a long(no it wasn't.)  
I propose a scenario for you one that will portray the situation but in the NA region. If Mexico were too try and join the CSTO. The US would feel threatened by that, having a Russian Ally on their doorstep would scare many Americans and the US itself. However the US would never do a pre emtive invasion of Mexico. For 2 Simple Reasons. One, the US has to much economic infrastructure to risk a war with Mexico, and Two. Because unlike Russia the US is not a one Party Far Right Reactionary Dictatorship. So there would never be a consensus on the issue, if the Democrat's were in power during this situation the Dems wouldn't do anything. If the Republican's where in Power they also wouldn't do anything, not because they don't want to but because they can't, It would be political suicide, would cause a recession and would likely mean the other party taking over, The US would loose massive amounts of credibility within its own country and around the world. Many Allies of the US would probably leave them in that situation and it would put the US in a worse position. and even then after all this the US still invades. The US has no Justification for it, because the Mexican people choose to join the CSTO. The same Way the Ukrainian, Finish, and Swedish now wish to be in NATO, and should be allowed to because its their wish and after a subsequent invasion of a neighbor of Russia's (in the case of Finland and Sweden) and for Ukraine, well getting Invaded is a good fucking reason to join a defensive alliance.

&#x200B;

SO My conclusion is. If you are Pro Russia that is fine, I disagree with you on every level on this conflict but that's your choice. However Do not go spoutting lies and propaganda about why Putin Started this war. WE already know why. Putin Wants to  Improve Russia's World standing. He wants to have Control over Ukraine and Belarus, Weather as a genuine ally, Puppet, or Directly. He himself said. 'Ukraine is not a sovereign Country' Its ok to support either side, but do not lie to your self that Putin was only trying to protect from scary NATO. He Invaded a sovereign country because they were trying to befriend a Foreign Enemy.   


(Epilogue) So when  you say why doesn't Ukraine beg for Peace, or Why doesn't the US and the West stop supplying Ukraine with weapons. Remember to tell yourself that it wouldn't bring a white peace for both sides to enjoy, its your Pro Russia Side getting a victory. so do not blame the west for supplying Ukraine, the same way the US couldn't blame Russia for supplying the Taliban in Afghanistan. You can get mad that they are but do not whine that its warmongering, because if the situation was reverse You would be saying the same thing to me about Russia Supplying (insert US Enemy Here) because its Geo politics.

So democrats equals gaypride and feminism equals ukraine equals the west is fighting for the upholding of feminism and lgbt equals russia bad?

He actively urged immigrants from north Africa to come to Belarus, promising access to the EU, knowing full well that Poland wouldn't let them cross the border. Thousands of people trapped, not allowed to enter Poland nor to go back into Belarus. And on top of that, Lukachenko actively blocked humanitarian aid. All these people were used as pawns to hurt the EU, because they put sanctions on Belarus because of his treatment of political opponents.

* **“For the rejection of the world’s third largest nuclear potential, Ukraine received security guarantees. We do not have those weapons, there is no security either.** There is no part of the territory of our state, and most importantly, there are no millions of our citizens,” Zelensky said.
* According to Zelesnky, Ukraine demands to move from a policy of appeasement to ensuring security and peace guarantees in Ukraine.
* Zelensky noted that he instructed the Foreign Ministry to convene a summit of the countries participating in the Budapest Memorandum, and if **it does not take place or does not provide Ukraine with security guarantees, it will be recognized by Kiev as invalid along with the clauses signed in 1994.**

China and France gave somewhat weaker individual assurances in separate documents.\[1\]*

>***The memorandum included security assurances against threats or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan.***

>Listen to the voice of reason. The people of Ukraine want peace, the authorities in Ukraine want peace, they want it and are doing everything they can for it. … We don’t need war. …

>But if we are attacked, if someone attempts to take away our land, our freedom, our lives, the lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. We won’t attack, but defend ourselves. By attacking, you will see our faces, not our backs, but our faces.

>War will remove guarantees from everyone. No one will have security guarantees any more. Who will suffer most of all from this? People. Who wants this the least? People. Who can not allow this to happen? People. There are these people among you, I’m sure of it.

>I know this speech of mine won’t be shown on Russian TV, but the people of Russia need to see it. They need to know the truth.

> Thanks to the enemy, Europe has realized real price for avoiding honest answers.

> The Kremlin has made yet another step towards resurrection of the Soviet Union, with a new Warsaw Pact and Berlin Wall.

> The only thing that stands in between is Ukraine and its army.

> Our choice is simple – to defend our country, our homes, our families. Nothing has changed for us.

> Now we shall see more true friends at our side. And the false friends, who prompted us to capitulate for years, will no hide.

> Tough road lies ahead. There will be losses. The pain, fear and disbelieve shall be overcome.

> But the victory shall be our reward. Because we are on our land and the truth is with us.

> The people support the Ukrainian army. The faith of people is a sign that we are doing aright.

> Now, the efforts of the military-political command of the state and the Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are focused on the strengthening the defense, in particular, on maximising our partners’ support, which we have partly received.

> Many guided by emotions will urge to chaotic decisions. We will not allow this. Our strength is in unity and confidence, and in cool head.

Excerpt: 

> When I returned for dissertation research in 2012, the default language was still Russian. Whenever I told people that my Ukrainian was stronger than my Russian, though, most people switched to Ukrainian. This was especially so with young people, who had mostly been educated in Ukrainian after 1991 (before 1989, Ukrainian-language schools were quite rare in the city). They chatted and cursed in Russian, but when I asked if they spoke Ukrainian, their beautiful...... slightly formal Ukrainian would come out. ""Of course! We learned it in school! We are Ukrainian citizens, and no one speaks Ukrainian better than Kharkivites!"" And of course no one in Ukraine spoke more idiomatic, sarcastic, and hilarious Russian, either.

[...]

> A new war would prove quite different from past Russian offensives during the summer of 2014 and winter 2015. Those battles resulted in the Minsk I and II ceasefires, imposed on Ukraine at gunpoint, but the deals are widely acknowledged in Moscow to have been failures that did not achieve Russia’s political aims. Repeating such operations—limited wars to coerce Ukraine into a deal—would come at great economic cost in exchange for no tangible benefit. Ukraine’s armed forces have improved and expanded considerably since 2014. A smaller war confined to the Donbas would incur higher casualties today, without good prospects for achieving any political objectives. If Russia seeks a quick and decisive victory, it will therefore have to dramatically expand the scope of the conflict—and the types of forces employed.


> Russia has positioned more than 150,000 troops to surround Ukraine from Belarus in the north to Crimea in the south. Together with Russian-led forces in the Donbas, and auxiliaries including Rosgvardia, Russia’s national guard, this figure may exceed 190,000. These ground forces are supported by hundreds of tactical aircraft, forward-deployed attack helicopters and the Russian navy. This is not a force for a limited campaign, but one designed to pursue maximalist political aims. Russia will seek to surround and isolate Ukrainian forces in pockets of territory, forcing them to surrender, and attempt to impose regime change in Kyiv.


> The Russian disposition of forces suggests that its general staff intends to conduct two major pincer movements into Ukraine. The lesser of the two will advance from the north on the capital, Kyiv. The larger attack will seek to encircle Ukrainian forces near Donbas. Russian-led units there may serve as a pinning force, while the main Russian grouping would advance from the north-east by Kharkiv and from Crimea in the south. In this scenario, Moscow would try to prevent Ukrainian forces from being able to conduct an organised retreat to more defensible terrain west of the Dnieper river.


> This war would begin with air strikes, missile strikes and use of electronic warfare and cyber-attacks. Their goal would be to degrade, fragment and paralyse the Ukrainian armed forces along with its political leadership. This air campaign would be brief, followed by a combined arms ground offensive. Russia’s ground force is an artillery army with tanks and mechanised infantry. It emphasises decisive use of firepower. These formations would be backed by attack helicopters, tactical bombers and missile brigades. Those supporting elements would dramatically increase the effectiveness of Russian ground formations in combat.


> Although Ukraine’s armed forces have improved since the fighting of 2014-2015, so have Russia’s. The units surrounding Ukraine are largely staffed by contract soldiers—professional servicemen, rather than conscripts—with high levels of readiness, modernised equipment and officers bloodied in several conflicts, such as the war in Syria. Ukraine’s military is understaffed, poorly supplied, and inexperienced in manoeuvre warfare. Russian forces therefore have considerable quantitative and qualitative superiority.


> Much is contingent in war, but Ukraine’s odds are grim in a conventional fight, even with Western-supplied weapons. Its forces might convert into partisan warfare, or take to the cities. The latter would prove a difficult decision as urban warfare is immensely destructive. Moscow probably hopes to organise local security forces, or to co-opt political elites, to avoid being dragged into urban combat. The current Russian force may be enough to occupy Ukraine’s eastern regions and the capital, but if Russian leaders believe they can control large parts of the country, they are likely to be walking into a sustained insurgency.


> Although Moscow has the military advantage, Russian pronouncements on Ukraine suggest that the Kremlin suffers from a high degree of war optimism—a common mistake made by aggressors throughout history. These conflicts tend to drag on well beyond the initial campaign, or escalate into regional wars. America’s experience in Iraq was hardly an aberration. Using force is always a gamble.

> This is the issue. If Ukraine's military tries to fight a conventional war with Russia, it will be defeated. An unconventional fight means moving into cities, which will lead to greater civilian casualties. All urban warfare is destructive and Russia lacks large PGM stockpiles.

> If Russia tries to conduct regime change, it will likely try to install someone who would reach out to elites in other cities. But if Russian forces go into cities, a lot of civilians could die. That would only increase resistance and make conflict termination more difficult.

> The big question is whether Russia can translate the use of military force into achieving its political goals and what will it do if it can't? A Russian invasion now would be an attempt to achieve what 2014-2015 failed to do, so more force is likely and compromise is less likely.

Ukraine more than stood their ground with a parity of equipment but being well out-numbered.

Now? Ukraine has a surge of human support and the heavy weapons they asked for are pouring in.

Modern weapons. Russian replacements are Soviet era rags, their ""reinforcements"" conscripts and poorly paid mercenaries.

> Moscow says it is effectively at war with NATO - and has warned that Western weapons are inflaming the conflict in Ukraine.

> Speaking on the 61st day of the war, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said continual deliveries of supplies and weaponry to Ukraine means the NATO alliance has positioned itself as &quot;In essence engaged in war with Russia&quot;.

> Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, but its forces have now fully withdrawn from around the capital Kyiv and much of northern Ukraine to Belarus and back to Russia.

2129,"So basically, Russia called it a special military operation to put on a facade that their military was still mighty and that they would not have to engage in a full war to take Ukraine. As it turns out, Ukraine has enough bodies and the west has enough weapons/cash to bolster them against the Russian army. As it turns out, the Russian army is actually a big pile of shit. 

In order to save face to their own people, Russia is now say that it is a war against NATO—they’re obviously NOT at war with NATO, but I’d a narrative to help them save face when it comes to why they’re making little to no progress. 

In reality, if Russia and NATO were actually at war, Russia would’ve been defeated quite quickly. Putin and Russia are now left with no allies other than former Soviet countries (even they are starting to turn on Russia) and China. In the end, I think Russia is going to basically become a satellite state for China.",2022-04-26,uc5g2s,i69hxgz

Not only that, it's become a wake-up call to all those defence sluggards, like Germany, to rapidly start rebuilding their militaries.

Not only that, but it's shown those fence-sitters, like Finland and Sweden, where safety really lies.

All good for NATO.

Not only that, it's a chance for the West to see who is really on our side, and who is supporting the Dark Side - people like India and Hungary. And where China sits.

Not only that, Putin has shown his hand and gone all in on tyranny. Now no one can pretend they don't see what he really is - except of course those people that are the same kind, and now we can see who they are too.

The sanctions will slowly have an effect on Russia's economy, and eventually break them financially. A weak military AND a weak economy will push Russia back to the 1990s.

It's bad news for Ukraine in the short-term, but the longer this 'war' goes on, the weaker Russia will become and the less of a future threat Putin and his cronies will be.",2022-04-26,uc5g2s,i68n1xp

>  
>Speaking on the sideline of a Nato meeting in Brussels last week, Wallace was not being glib. The Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — the north-eastern flank of the transatlantic alliance — had long warned of a potential Russian attack before Moscow’s onslaught against Ukraine began in February.  
>  
>Now, as Russia steps up its threats against the Baltic states — including over access to its Kaliningrad exclave — and days before the organisation’s annual summit in Madrid, the debate over the type of support Nato allies should provide them has intensified.  
>  
>Germany announced last week that it would commit 3,500 extra troops to defend Lithuania, but that it would keep the majority of them stationed at home.  
>  
>Berlin’s approach has support among other Western allies: concerned by the cost of long-term deployments and the possibility of provoking Moscow, they argue that pre-positioning some equipment and flying in troops at short notice is the smarter move. But vulnerable allies, such as Lithuania, say they need thousands of Nato troops, fully armed and supplied, to respond immediately to any Russian attack.  
>  
>Margarita Šešelgytė, director of the Institute of International Relations and Political Science at Vilnius University, said the German approach “is not a good message for us”.  
>  
>“In terms of our security, \[pre-positioned defence forces\] is a must. We lack the strategic depth,” she said. “Ukraine was and is able to defend itself because of that . . . Baltic countries in general could be overrun by Russian forces within a week.”  
>  
>Permanent bases, such as those set up by the US in Germany after the second world war, are expensive. Troops travel with their families, requiring sprawling complexes with housing and schools.  
>  
>Instead, Nato’s “enhanced forward presence” of foreign-led battle groups in eastern countries set up in 2017 and expanded this spring, relies on “unaccompanied” troop deployments — soldiers on temporary rotation, in other words, sometimes living in tents, like an extended military exercise.  
>  
>“I think that this is the way forward,” said Kajsa Ollongren, the Dutch defence minister. “We agree on the German approach which I think fits a strategy that we should have for the whole eastern flank of Nato, which means a stronger posture, but it’s also flexible.”  
>  
>“It’s also more sustainable, because you don’t have to have everything and everybody in place, but you have to be very quick in response and have the forces ready,” she added.  
>  
>The Netherlands contributes troops to the German-led Nato battlegroup in Lithuania. The UK leads the battlegroup in Estonia, Canada in Latvia and the US in Poland.  
>  
>Many Nato capitals argue that a more nimble approach, with the ability to deploy quickly where necessary, is a better deterrent than fixed defences that any potential invader could plan to avoid.  
>  
>But that relies on vulnerable frontier states trusting that their allies would deploy quickly enough and with the necessary force to repel a concentrated attack.  
>  
>The US 82nd Airborne boasts of its ability to deploy anywhere on the planet within 18 hours. But few, if any, other fighting units of their size and competence can match that.  
>  
>Before Russia’s renewed invasion of Ukraine in February, Nato spoke of a “tripwire” strategy, where a few thousand troops in eastern countries would serve as an initial attack deterrent, before serious reinforcements arrived.  
>

This is similar to the UK's defence approach to the Falkland Islands. 

The problem with this defence is:

1) It relies on good intelligence and a belief that it is necessary to ""pull the trigger"" and commence the operation. We saw with Ukraine that European intelligence was shoddy and actions were delayed so as ""not to antagonise"" Russia even as it completed its own build-up.

2) Without sufficient missile defence Russian strikes could take out the airfields and any pre-positioned equipment sitting in warehouses before NATO soldiers arrive to disperse it. At which point you're back to racing to the Suwalki Gap.

3) Multiple countries coming together to provide rapid reinforcement is complex. You have to seriously commit to it and be willing to carry out full-scale exercises, not just write a theoretical paper.",2022-06-22,vhz0q7,idaeef0

Not only does it significantly reinforce the flank but provides, at least with American bases as the example, a large economic influx for the host country as well as a significant cultural exchange. That's what happens when you send large populations of your people to work and live abroad. For a Europe, a Western world, that is seeking to become ever more entwined and close knit, these are good things.

The contradiction made me realize, if a conflict goes nuclear, those few seconds do not matter. He knows how inefficient his conventional military is. It is highly trained NATO conventional forces on his frontier that he fears. If NATO rolls east, Russia is almost defenseless {except for nukes}, and he knows it.

Edit add: More likely, if Putin massed Russian troops along its western frontier for a quick strike into the West, NATO troops along that frontier could quickly establish air superiority and then use pre-positioned artillery and armor to decimate his conventional forces simply holding the line.",2022-05-15,uppube,i8n63st

""The Russian Federation has announced the closure from next week to October 2021 of part of the Black Sea in the direction of the Kerch Strait for warships and state vessels of other countries under the pretext of military exercises.

 Such actions of the Russian Federation are another attempt in violation of the norms and principles of international law to usurp the sovereign rights of Ukraine as a coastal state, as it is Ukraine that has the rights to regulate navigation in these areas of the Black Sea.

 This step is also a gross violation of the right to freedom of navigation guaranteed by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.  According to the Convention, the Russian Federation must not obstruct or impede transit through the international strait to ports in the Sea of ​​Azov.

 Against the background of the ongoing increase in its military presence along the border with Ukraine on land, Russia has begun to intensify the escalation at sea.  It transfers warships from the Caspian Sea and strengthens its military potential in the Azov-Black Sea region, and, despite the lack of legal grounds, decided to close this area to warships of other countries, including Ukraine.

 The behavior of the Russian side indicates the absence of any intention on its part to refuse to continue the aggression against Ukraine using military and hybrid methods.

 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine strongly protests against these actions of the Russian Federation and demands the immediate cancellation of the decision to illegally close certain waters of the Black Sea.

 We call on international partners to increase political and diplomatic pressure on the aggressor state in order to cancel the decision to close the waters and stop the escalation in the Azov-Black Sea region.""",2021-04-15,mrh8sa,gum74us

2766,"I don't see it.  I thought about it at first, but no more.  Here's why - NATO nations are flooding Ukraine with ammunition, weapons systems, and even aircraft.  There's no way Russia doesn't know how these things are getting in to the country - between satellite intelligence, human intelligence, signal intelligence, etc.  Yet they're not bombing or attacking any of those lanes.  Assuming it is correct that they know how these things are coming in to the country, I think they're not attacking because they respect the NATO alliance and know that their military is not up to the challenge.  They would be wiped out in a head-to-head with NATO, which would leave nuclear weapons as the only alternative.  Nukes are a no-win proposition in warfare.  Their only value is in negotiation and leverage, as we're seeing in this situation (nobody will get directly involved because of their nuclear threat).  Just my opinion.",2022-04-20,u7s139,i5ijkde

2777,"I think the one thing that everyone forgets is that the countries that have nuclear weapons only have them so that they DON'T have to use them.  They're a deterrence, and considered the sum of all end games for whomever ends up using them. 

RuSSia wants to occupy Ukraine and/or the geographically important parts to the south and east. It would have been quicker & easier to level an entire city like Mariupol with one atomic WMD than the 2 months of constant shelling and bombing... but nuking something into submission is counterproductive to any plans of setting up shop in the coming decades.   


The wildcard in this current situation is the respect, sympathy, and compassion of innocent people and all human life that Putin obviously lacks. I really think it would take a direct attack on Moscow or other large culturally or militarily important places on RuSSian soil in order for Putin to go all-in on proving how big of a douchebag he is.    


The USA is still the only people that have ever used a nuclear weapon, and hopefully remain the only people that ever used them offensively.",2022-04-22,u7s139,i5rxwd2

2782,"Putin has a paradoxical combination of grandiose plans for Russia and paranoia of a NATO we know doesn’t any longer exist to counterbalance a USSR that no longer exists. He has this life stage/identity dilemma, but he knows the consequences of a nuclear exchange. 

He knows how he is being perceived. No one sees him as a misunderstood but well intentioned leader. If he used nukes, no one would consider it justified. Both China and Russia rely on grey zone actions which individually don’t warrant a kinetic response but cumulatively may. A nuclear attack would certainly necessitate retaliation. Mutually assured destruction is still very real and Russia’s conventional military is weak.  What does it have left to persuade us with? Tactical nukes?
